# fpds
A no-frills parser for the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS)
at https://www.fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/index.php/en/.


## Motivation
The only programmatic access to this data via an ATOM feed limits each
request to 10 records, which forces users to deal with pagination.
Additonally, data is exported as XML, which proves annoying for most
developers. `fpds` will handle all pagination and data
transformation to provide users with a nice JSON representation of the
equivalent XML data.


## Setup
To install this package for development, create a virtual environment
and install dependencies.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -e .
```


## Usage
For a list of valid search criteria parameters, consult FPDS documentation
found at: https://www.fpds.gov/wiki/index.php/Atom_Feed_Usage. Parameters
will follow the `URL String` format shown in the link above, with the
following exceptions:

 + Colons (:) will be replaced by equal signs (=)
 + Certain parameters enclose their value in quotations. `fpds` will
automatically determine if quotes are needed, so simply enclose your
entire criteria string in quotes.

 For example, `AGENCY_CODE:”3600”` should be used as `"AGENCY_CODE=3600"`.


Via CLI:
```
$  fpds parse params "LAST_MOD_DATE=[2022/01/01, 2022/05/01]" "AGENCY_CODE=7504"
```


By default, data will be dumped into an `.fpds` folder at the user's
`$HOME` directory. If you wish to override this behavior, provide the `-o`
option. The directory will be created if it doesn't exist:

```
$  fpds parse params "LAST_MOD_DATE=[2022/01/01, 2022/05/01]" "AGENCY_CODE=7504" -o {some-directory}
```

Same request via python interpreter:
```
from fpds import fpdsRequest

request = fpdsRequest(
    LAST_MOD_DATE="[2022/01/01, 2022/05/01]",
    AGENCY_CODE="7504"
)

# Records saved as a python list
records = request()
```

For linting and formatting, we use `flake8` and `black`.

```
$ make lint
$ make formatters
```

Lastly, you can clean the clutter and unwanted noise.

```
$ make clean
```

### Testing
```
$ make test
```


## Additional Notes
To ensure no data is lost during export, `fpds` will save tag attributes as
individual data elements. For example, parsing the `contractActionType` tag
and extracting the text value would only return `E` and omit data contained
in the `description` and `part80orPart13` attributes.

```
 <ns1:contractActionType description="BPA" part8OrPart13="PART8">E</ns1:contractActionType>
```

When parsing such elements, `fpds` will represent the tag above in the
following manner:

```
    {
        "contractActionType": "E",
        "contractActionType__description": "BPA"
        "contractActionType__part8OrPart13": "PART8"
    }
```
